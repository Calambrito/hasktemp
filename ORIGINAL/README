============== About ===========================

This is the source code accompanying the paper

     Finding Connected Subgraphs of Fixed Minimum Density:
     Implementation and Experiments

by Christian Komusiewicz, Manuel Sorge, and Kolja Stahl, to appear in
the Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Experimental
Algorithms, LNCS, Springer, 2015.

The source code implements an algorithm for finding subgraphs of a
given minimum density (the ratio of the number of edges present to the
maximum number edges possible) and of a given minimum number of
vertices.

============== Prerequisites ===================

Haskell Compiler (https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and Cabal
(https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).

The preferred way to install Haskell is using the Haskell Platform:
https://www.haskell.org/platform/

The program has been tested on OS X 10.10 and Ubuntu 14.10 with GHC
7.8.4 (earlier versions work as well, when manually installing the
depedencies).

=============== Building =======================

There is an build script: build.sh which might be more convenient,
doing the following steps:

If cabal is installed, it should suffice to simply run the following commands in the directory of the source code:

cabal update
cabal configure
# if dependencies are missing it might be necessary to:
#    cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal build

The directory should include connected_mu_clique.hs, Graph.hs and
connected_mu_clique.cabal. Cabal should be able to install the
required dependencies.

If that's not the case (i.e. following message appears: cabal: Run the
'configure' command first.): at least text, vector, pqueue, time and
directory are needed. See the cabal project file for further
information (connected_mu_clique.cabal).

To install text, for example, use the following commands:
cabal update
cabal install text

The built program is located in
dist/build/connected-mu-clique/connected-mu-clique and comes with the
--help flag.

To manually compile the program, use:

ghc -O2 -fexcess-precision -funfolding-use-threshold=16 \\
    -o connected-mu-clique connected_mu_clique.hs -threaded -rtsopts

=============== Program Call =================

connected_mu_clique [OPTION...] file

The options are:
    --help                     print this help
    --pb, --simple-p-bound     enable simple P-Bound
    --ipb, --inner-p-bound     enable Inner P-Bound
    --tb, --turan-bound        enable Turan Bound
    --opb, --outer-p-bound     enable Outer P-Bound
    --ppb, --pairwise-p-bound  enable Pairwise P-Bound
    --sort-by-degree           sort by degree
    --sort-by-degeneracy       sort by degeneracy
    --sort-by-nbrs-in-p        sort by neighbors in P
    --sort-optimistic          sorts differently depending on graph properties (same as: sort-by-degree and sort-by-degeneracy combined)
    --sort-pessimistic         inverts the ordering
    --score                    sorts by score and nbrs in P, simple P-Bound enabled
    --twins                    enable Twins-Rule
    --disable-nbrhood          disable Neighborhood Tie-Breaker
    --k[=k]                    k (solution size), if ommited: k will be continuously increased, starting with k = 2
    --t[=t], --timeout[=t]     timeout (s), if ommited: no timeout is set
    --mu=m                     minimum density of the solution


===================== Execution ===================

Example:

./connected-mu-clique keller4 --mu=0.7 --score --t=3600

With this call, the program tries to find a connected μ-Clique with μ
>= 0.7 in the keller4 graph. The time limit is set to 1 hour. It sorts
the nodes according to degree order and uses the simple P-Bound.


=============== Supported Graph Format ============

Graphs are in DIMACS Format (each line is an edge):

       e v1 v2

or simply

       v1 v2

which denotes an edge from v1 to v2.
